      <figcaption>Brazillian Cherry floor Installation</figcaption>
      <p>Here we installed a custom three inch wide Brazilian Cherry
      floor in a home in Stillwater, Mn. The rooms are framed with a staggered
      corner border and accented with a frame of American cherry. The body of
      the floor was then filled with the Brazilian Cherry. To help insure a long
      lasting beautiful floor for years to come, we applied a oil sealer and then
      top coated with three coats of Bona Traffic water based polyurethane.

      <figcaption>Brazillian Walnut floor Installation</figcaption>
      <p>Here we installed a three inch wide Brazilian Walnut floor with an open
      staircase. This is a custom home designed by renowned architect David Salmela
      in Marine On St. Croix, Mn. The Brazilian Walnut is one of the hardest woods
      available and was chosen for that reason in addition to its striking beauty.
      The Floor was then finished with three coats of "Street Shoe" commercial
      strength water based polyurethane.

      <figcaption>Interlaced Oak Floor Installation</figcaption>
      <p>This example is an interlaced red oak install. Our customer had an addition
      off the back of there home and wanted to preserve the existing hardwood
      floors. To achieve a seamless look we used a technique called "interlacing"
      or "weaving" the old floor with the new one. Matching wood species here is
      crucial and staggering the boards just right equals a floor you would think
      was there since the house was built. This home is on Minnehaha Creek in
      Minneapolis.

      <figcaption>Maple Floor Installation</figcaption>
      <p>This is a maple floor, board dimensions 2 1/4 inch wide by 3/4 inches
      thick. After we installed and sanded floor we applied three coats of oil
      modified polyurethane. Buffing between final coats. Some of the features to
      notice here are the flush framing of the fire place and flush mounted floor
      vents. Making as many features flush to floor is attractive not to mention
      creating fewer tripping possibilities. This work was completed for a customer
      in Lino Lakes.

      <figcaption>Kitchen Floor Refinishing</figcaption>
      <p>When we arrived at this home in Minneapolis we thought there was little
      hope for these hardwood floors. After some intense sanding the home owner
      was pleased to find a beautiful hardwood hiding underneath. Most of the
      home owners in Minneapolis and St Paul have thousands of dollars worth of
      hardwood floors covered by wall to wall carpeting. These floors could be
      repaired and refinished at a very reasonable cost, totally transforming the
      quality of life of the home owner.

      <figcaption>Douglas Fir Restoration</figcaption>
      <p>Here is a Douglas Fir floor in a 100 year old commercial space in
      Minneapolis.This floor was covered in many layers of tile and adhesive.
      After days of slowly removing the tile and adhesive we were able to do
      extensive sanding and restore the beauty to this abused and neglected
      floor. When the sanding was complete we coated the floor with three
      coats of oil modified polyurethane for a classic look.
