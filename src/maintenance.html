      <figcaption>PROTECT YOUR FLOOR</figcaption>
      <p>Place throw rugs in front of kitchen sink and any doors leading outside
      where heavy traffic occurs. However, do not do this until at least two weeks
      after the finish has been applied. Chairs, and any other furniture that is
      moved frequently, should have floor glides attached to the bottom of each
      leg to help prevent scratching and wear. Don't allow water to come in contact
      with the floor for the first two weeks after it has been finished, water
      marks may occur.</p>

      <figcaption>DAILY DUST MOPPING OR VACUUMING</figcaption>
      <p>Regular dust mopping or vacuuming is an essential part of hardwood floor
      care. A good quality dust mop or vacuum head is the most effective tool
      for cleaning dust and dirt off the floor. To keep you floor looking its
      best, dust mop or vacuum at least twice a week. Dust or vacuum more often
      on floors with heavy traffic.</p>

      <figcaption>REGULAR CLEANING</figcaption>
      <p>Spills and tracked in dirt can be cleaned by lightly damp mopping the
      floor with a household sponge mop. Use clean water for regular sponge
      mopping. DO NOT over-wet the mop. Excessive water can damage the floor.
      In addition to cleaning with water, we recommend using "Bona Swedish
      Formula Hardwood Floor Cleaner" Which is available from Restoration
      Hardware or you can also use Zep Hardwood floor cleaner from Home Depot.
      Do not use any other products, most of them can look nice but leave a
      wax build up on your floor.</p>

      <figcaption>PERIODIC RECOATING</figcaption>
      <p>Following a regular maintenance program will preserve the life of you
      hardwood floor for years. Eventually your floor may need to be recoated.
      A hardwood floor should be recoated when the original finish is showing
      signs of wear but before it has worn down to the bare wood. Bare wood will
      be stained by dirt and grime and will need to be resanded. Be sure to call
      and schedule your buff and recoat at first sign of wear. A typical floor
      may need another coat anywhere from 4 to 7 years depending on customer
      wear. A buff and recoat can be one-third the price of resanding a floor.</p>
