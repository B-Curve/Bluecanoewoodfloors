      <h1>Who We Are</h1>
      <img src="./images/who.jpg" alt="who" />
      <p>Ben and David started Blue Canoe back in the spring of 2000.
      Previous to that David, a Twin Cities native, was involved in music,
      growing a family and also restoring hardwood floors on the weekends
      starting as far back as 1992. Ben, grew up in South Dakota, was a musician,
      artist and family man with 3 boys and wife. Ben and David met each other
      through music and played together in a few different musical projects.
      Seeing an opportunity to start a company in a growth service field that
      would be gratifying to their artistic sides they started Blue Canoe.
      Our goal is to be different than other companies by providing great service
      and outstanding quality at a competitive price.</p>

      <p>Blue Canoe uses the best available materials to insure the best possible
      results. Using higher quality finishes means better flow, better sheen,
      greater durability and overall look. All wood is purchased from high quality
      hardwood flooring suppliers who are trusted with the care of hardwood and
      regulation of humidity to insure the wood installed in your home is more
